# This repo was from a *long* time ago. It is maintained here for my personal nostalgia - not intended for community use.
## Once upon a time I did a summer research internship (on the topic of optics) at the University of Applied Sciences of Zwickau (in Germany), under the supervision of (the now Dr.) Christopher Taudt, and his advisor Dr. Peter Hartmann.
## The code (from what I recall) creates matlab plots demonstrating the refractive properties of various optically transparent materials. We used a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to fit published refractive index data to some function we pulled from another publication and compared these to the results we collected independently in the lab.
## My adherence to coding best practices has come a long way since those days.
